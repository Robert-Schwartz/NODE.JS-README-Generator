## Technologies
HTML, JavaScript, ES6, Node.js, NPM inquirer package.

## Installation
Requires download of NPM package of Inquirer and Node.js on computer to run.

## Usage
Open the command line and then run node index.js.  You will then be given a series of prompts to provide the content of a new README file.  Once the prompts finish, a new file called README.md will generate in your directory.  Open the new README.md to view the contents and make edits if needed.
